# wavetankanalisyscode
Code used to analyze the individual wave trains produced in the wave tank.
The algorithm uses control points ot track the local maxima and minima of the waves generated, the control points are then using along with the distances between the wave probes and the recorded velocities of each crest to derive propiertiesthe wavelenghts and wave velocities of propagation.

The code is written in Wolfram language which is free to use in some plattaforms, the algorithm is simple and could ve translated easily to python/R/swift. The code was written using a raspberry pi device.

The code beign gpl does not grant any type of license about the language is written on or the use of any wolfram product.
